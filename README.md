# 🤖 ChatGPT Mini

ChatGPT Mini is a lightweight offline AI assistant written in Python.

It runs entirely from a local brain file:

Downloads/chatgpts ai/data/school.txt

No APIs  
No internet required (except opening websites)  
No tracking  

---

# 📥 IMPORTANT INSTALLATION

You MUST put the folder directly inside your Downloads folder.

Correct location:

Downloads
└── chatgpts ai
    └── data
        └── school.txt

DO NOT:
• Rename "chatgpts ai"
• Rename the "data" folder
• Delete anything inside the data folder

The AI will stop working if you change these.

---

# 🧠 Brain File Rules

The AI ONLY learns from:

data/school.txt

Correct format:

question = answer

Example:

what is pi = 3.14159  
capital of france = paris  

If the file is missing or formatted wrong, the AI cannot answer questions.
